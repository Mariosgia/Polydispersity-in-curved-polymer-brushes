# Polydispersity-in-curved-polymer-brushes
Repository for the solution of the self-consistent equations discussed in the paper

The repository contains c++ code for the numerical solution of curved polymer brushes with or without an EEZ. In the case an EEZ is expected, the capabilities of the algorith extend only to the case where a single EEZ is expected. 

We also have included some bash and mathematica scripts that are used in conjuction with the c++ scripts.
